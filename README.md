## Primitive functions for Cryptographic systems

In the realms of cryptographic systems, including AES-Rijndael, RSA, and Diffie-Hellman, a fundamental reliance on mathematical principles underpins secure communication. The initiation of these protocols involves receiving input values or keys, marked as $\alpha$ and $\beta$. These inputs are pivotal, fueling the ensuing series of transformations and encryptions. An initial transformation function, denoted as $\Phi$, adapts these inputs for further cryptographic processes. This function's nature varies across algorithms: $\Phi$ might signify key expansion within AES, the derivation of public keys in Diffie-Hellman, or engage in modular arithmetic for RSA key creation.

The core of these cryptographic systems is encapsulated in the key generation process, symbolized by $\Lambda$. This function processes the initial inputs, possibly alongside significant prime or composite numbers ($\eta$ or $\xi$), to concoct encryption and decryption keys. The essence of RSA lies in harnessing these prime numbers to forge a robust framework for secure key exchanges. In contrast, Diffie-Hellman utilizes them to generate a shared secret across an unsecured channel, whereas AES orchestrates a similar methodology to produce a series of round keys for its cipher operations.

Central to the operation of these systems are the encryption and decryption processes, represented by the functions $\Omega$ and $\Theta$, respectively. Encryption, $\Omega$, metamorphoses plaintext into an unintelligible ciphertext employing the previously generated keys. Conversely, decryption, $\Theta$, reverts this ciphertext back to its original plaintext form. These processes hinge on intricate mathematical computations, such as modular exponentiation, to ensure the impracticality of deciphering encrypted data without the corresponding keys.

An additional security dimension is woven into these systems through pseudo-random operations, encapsulated by the function $\Gamma$. This function introduces complexity and unpredictability, countering pattern recognition tactics like those utilized in differential power analysis. The integration of pseudo-random values within the encryption methodology or during key generation fortifies the algorithms' resilience against a spectrum of cryptographic assaults. Despite the unique mechanisms and applications distinguishing AES-Rijndael, RSA, and Diffie-Hellman, their commonality lies in the processing of initial values, the execution of complex transformations for key generation, and the fundamental principles governing encryption and decryption. Each algorithm deploys mathematical rigor and computational complexity to safeguard data integrity, underpinned by the security afforded by prime number theory and modular arithmetic.

### Theory

Cryptographic systems, such as AES-Rijndael, RSA, and Diffie-Hellman, secure communication is facilitated through a series of mathematical transformations. The commencement of these protocols entails the reception of input values or keys, symbolized as $\alpha$ and $\beta$. These initial inputs are foundational, paving the way for the ensuing key generation and encryption processes. They undergo an initial transformation function, denoted as $\Phi$, which varies across algorithms:

- In AES-Rijndael, $\Phi$ potentially signifies key expansion.
- For Diffie-Hellman, $\Phi$ is typically associated with the generation of public keys.
- Within RSA, $\Phi$ encompasses the modular arithmetic essential for the creation of public and private keys.

This is mathematically represented as:
$$\Phi(\alpha, \beta) \rightarrow \text{Intermediate values for further processing}$$

Following this, the key generation phase, symbolized by the function $\Lambda$, plays a pivotal role. It utilizes the initial inputs alongside potentially significant prime or composite numbers, represented by $\eta$ or $\xi$, to forge keys crucial for the encryption and decryption mechanisms. This pivotal step is mathematically articulated as:
$$\Lambda(\alpha, \beta, \eta \text{ or } \xi) \rightarrow \text{Keys for encryption and decryption}$$

Central to these cryptographic frameworks are the encryption and decryption functions, $\Omega$ and $\Theta$, respectively. These functions, employing the keys generated by $\Lambda$, convert plaintext to ciphertext and inversely:
$$\Omega(\text{Plaintext}, \text{Key}) \rightarrow \text{Ciphertext}$$
$$\Theta(\text{Ciphertext}, \text{Key}) \rightarrow \text{Plaintext}$$

Executing complex mathematical operations, such as modular exponentiation, these functions ensure the infeasibility of decrypting encrypted data without the appropriate keys.

Further enhancing these cryptographic systems' security is the introduction of pseudo-random operations via the function $\Gamma$. This function injects complexity and unpredictability into the cryptographic workflow, counteracting pattern recognition strategies utilized in attacks like differential power analysis. Incorporating pseudo-random values into either the encryption procedure or the cryptographic key generation process strengthens the algorithms' defenses against assorted cryptographic threats.

Despite the unique functionalities and applications distinguishing AES-Rijndael, RSA, and Diffie-Hellman, they converge on the reliance on initial value processing, sophisticated transformations for key generation, and the fundamental tenets of encryption and decryption. Each algorithm leverages mathematical precision and computational complexity, fortified by the protective measures of prime number theory and modular arithmetic, to safeguard data integrity.

### The Sequence

The cryptographic methods AES-Rijndael, RSA, and Diffie-Hellman, while each unique in design and application, fundamentally rely on shared mathematical principles to enable secure communication. This common ground is highlighted in their methodical approach to initializing variables, transforming initial inputs, generating keys, performing encryption/decryption processes, and incorporating pseudo-random operations for enhanced security.
