The Diffie-Hellman claims detail the invention of a secure key generation and communication system that operates over an insecure communication channel. The system uses transformations of signals to generate secure cipher keys that are infeasible to invert or generate without proper inputs. This method ensures secure communication by encrypting and decrypting messages using the generated keys. Here's a breakdown of the claims:

## Claim 1: Secure Key Generator
- **Components**: Consists of a first input, second input, first output, second output, and means for generating signals.
- **Functionality**: Generates a third signal from the first signal and a fourth signal from the second signal. Both transformations are infeasible to invert, and the fourth signal, representing a secure key, cannot be generated with just the second and third signals.

## Claim 2: Secure Communication Method
- **Involves**: Generating transformed signals at both transmitter and receiver that are infeasible to invert.
- **Secure cipher keys**: Generated by both the transmitter and receiver through specific transformations, ensuring they match (third and fourth signals).
- **Messages**: Encrypted with the secure cipher key before transmission and decrypted at the receiver.

## Claim 3: Authentication Feature
- **Adds**: A step to Claim 2's method by authenticating the receiver at the transmitter through the receiver's ability to generate the correct secure cipher key.

## Claim 4: Secure Cipher Key Generation Method
- **Similar**: To Claim 2 but focuses on the steps involved in generating the secure cipher key between transmitter and receiver.

## Claim 5: Apparatus for Generating Secure Cipher Key
- **Describes**: A more complex system involving two secure key generators for transforming signals into secure keys through infeasible-to-invert transformations.

## Claim 6: Specific Method for Generating Secure Cipher Key
- **Specifies**: The mathematical operations for transforming signals into secure cipher keys, including raising numbers to powers modulo a second number.

## Claim 7: Specific Apparatus for Secure Cipher Key Generation
- **Similar**: To Claim 5 but details the mathematical operations for the transformations, including exponentiation modulo a prime number.

## Claim 8: Detailed Apparatus for Generating Secure Cipher Key
- **Provides**: A detailed mathematical description of the transformations used to generate the secure cipher keys, including specific equations and conditions involving prime numbers and random numbers.

Each claim builds upon the previous ones by adding details or new elements to the secure key generation and communication process. The progression from claims about general methods and apparatuses to specific mathematical operations and authentication features illustrates the thoroughness in covering various aspects of secure communication over insecure channels.

To represent the Diffie-Hellman key exchange mechanism into mathematical notation with a focus on functions and variables at each stage, we outline the algorithm sequence using a table format.

- **Steps 3 & 4**: Both parties generate their public keys ($Y_i$ and $Y_j$) using their private keys ($x_i$ and $x_j$) and a common base ($a$) and prime ($q$).
- **Step 5**: The parties exchange their public keys over the insecure channel.
- **Step 6**: Each party computes the secure cipher key by raising the received public key to the power of their private key, modulo $q$, resulting in matching keys ($K_{ij} = K_{ji}$) for encryption and decryption.
- **Step 7** (Optional): Authentication can be performed based on the ability to correctly generate and use the secure cipher key.

# PATENT: Cryptographic apparatus and method

#### Inventor : Martin E. Hellman, Bailey W. Diffie, Ralph C. Merkle  
#### Current Assignee :  Stanford  University

## Abstract
A cryptographic system transmits a computationally secure cryptogram over an insecure communication channel without prearrangement of a cipher key. A secure cipher key is generated by the conversers from transformations of exchanged transformed signals. The conversers each possess a secret signal and exchange an initial transformation of the secret signal with the other converser. The received transformation of the other converser's secret signal is again transformed with the receiving converser's secret signal to generate a secure cipher key. The transformations use non-secret operations that are easily performed but extremely difficult to invert. It is infeasible for an eavesdropper to invert the initial transformation to obtain either conversers' secret signal, or duplicate the latter transformation to obtain the secure cipher key.

## Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange Algorithm  

1. **Transformation and Exchange Process:**
    - Each participant (converser) begins with a secret signal.
    - They transform their secret signal using public parameters and exchange the transformed signal with the other participant.
    - The transformation involves raising a base number to the power of their secret signal, modulo a large prime number.
    - The received transformed signal from the other participant is then re-transformed with the participant's own secret signal to generate a secure cipher key.

2. **Equations Involved:**
    - **Initial Transformation:** $Y_i = a^{X_i} \mod q$
      - Where $Y_i$ is the transformed signal, $a$ is the base number, $X_i$ is the secret signal, and $q$ is the large prime number.
    - **Secure Cipher Key Generation:** $K = (Y_j)^{X_i} \mod q = a^{X_i X_j} \mod q$
      - $K$ is the secure cipher key generated by both participants using the other's transformed signal $Y_j$ and their own secret signal $X_i$.

3. **Implementation Details:**
    - The transformation functions use non-secret operations that are easy to perform but difficult to invert, making it infeasible for an eavesdropper to obtain the secret signals or the secure cipher key.
    - The secure key generation method described allows communication over an insecure channel without prior exchange of a cipher key, enhancing security and privacy.
