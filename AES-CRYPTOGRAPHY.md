## AES Explained


Each of these equations represents a step in the AES encryption process, utilizing transformations and operations defined in the AES specification.

 1. **Key Expansion (Key Schedule):**
   AES generates a series of round keys from the cipher key using the Rijndael key schedule. The round keys are used in each round of the AES encryption and decryption processes.

 2. **Initial Round:**
   - **AddRoundKey:**
     Each byte of the state is combined with the round key using bitwise XOR.
     $$\text{State} \oplus \text{RoundKey}$$

 3. **Main Rounds:**
   Each main round consists of four operations:
   - **SubBytes:** A non-linear substitution step where each byte is replaced with another according to a lookup table.
   - **ShiftRows:** A transposition step where each row of the state is shifted cyclically a certain number of steps.
   - **MixColumns:** A mixing operation that operates on the columns of the state, combining the four bytes in each column.
   - **AddRoundKey:** Each byte of the state is combined with the round key using bitwise XOR.
   
   The MixColumns step is skipped in the final round.

 4. **Final Round:**
   The final round is similar to the main rounds but does not include the MixColumns operation.

    MixColumns(state)
    AddRoundKey(state, Key[round])
end for
SubBytes(state)
ShiftRows(state)
AddRoundKey(state, Key[Nr])
```

## Specific function pseudo code examples 
 This pseudocode aims to represent the key operations within the AES encryption process without delving into the detailed mathematics or the specific implementations that would be required in a real-world programming scenario.

### 1. KeyExpansion
```
func KeyExpansion(key []byte) -> [][]byte:
    Initialize an empty array for round keys
    Derive the first round key directly from the input key
    For each round:
        Derive the next round key based on the previous round key and the AES key schedule algorithm
        This includes operations like RotWord, SubWord, and Rcon application for key expansion
    Return the array of round keys
```

### 2. AddRoundKey
```
func AddRoundKey(state, roundKey []byte) -> []byte:
    Initialize a new byte array for the resulting state
    For each byte in the state:
        XOR the byte with the corresponding byte in the roundKey
        Store the result in the new state array
    Return the new state array
```

### 3. SubBytes
```
func SubBytes(state []byte) -> []byte:
    Initialize a new byte array for the resulting state
    For each byte in the state:
        Substitute the byte using the AES S-box
        Store the result in the new state array
    Return the new state array
```

### 4. ShiftRows
```
func ShiftRows(state []byte) -> []byte:
    Perform the row shifting operation on the state matrix
    Shift the first row by 0 (no shift)
    Shift the second row by 1 to the left
    Shift the third row by 2 to the left
    Shift the fourth row by 3 to the left
    Return the modified state as a byte array
```

### 5. MixColumns
```
func MixColumns(state []byte) -> []byte:
    For each column in the state matrix:
        Apply the MixColumns transformation
        This involves multiplying the column by a fixed polynomial in GF(2^8)
    Return the modified state as a byte array
```

These pseudocode snippets provide a high-level overview of each function's purpose within the AES encryption process. The actual implementation of these functions requires a deeper understanding of cryptographic principles, as well as specific algorithms for operations like byte substitution (S-box), row shifting, and column mixing.

## The AES Algorithm Sequence
Various cryptographic communication systems and methods that revolve around encoding (encryption) and decoding (decryption) mechanisms for secure message transmission. Here are the mathematical operations and principles extracted and expressed in LaTeX notation:

 1. **Encoding and Decoding Operations**:
   - Encoding (encryption): $C \equiv M^e \mod n$
   - Decoding (decryption): $M' \equiv C^d \mod n$
   Where $C$ is the ciphertext, $M$ is the plaintext message, $M'$ is the recovered plaintext message, $e$ and $d$ are the encryption and decryption exponents respectively, and $n$ is the modulus, a composite number obtained from two primes $p$ and $q$.

 2. **Key Generation**:
   - The relationship between $e$ and $d$: $ed \equiv 1 \mod \lambda(n)$
   Where $\lambda(n)$ is Carmichael's totient function, providing a value that satisfies the modular multiplication inverse for $e$ and $d$ in the key generation process.

 3. **Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)**:
   - Conditions for public and private keys in a PKI system are discussed, focusing on the computational infeasibility of deriving the private key from the public key.

 4. **Polynomial Evaluation for Encoding and Decoding**:
   - Alternative encoding method: $C = f(M) \mod n$, where $f(M)$ is a polynomial function of $M$.
   - Corresponding decoding operations involve finding roots of polynomial equations modulo $n$ and selecting the correct root based on message structure or additional information.

 5. **Block Transformation**:
   - For long messages that exceed the range of $n$, a blocking system is employed to partition the message into smaller blocks, each of which can be individually encoded or decoded.

 6. **Composite Numbers and Prime Factors**:
   - The security of the system is highlighted as relying on the difficulty of factoring the composite number $n = pq$, where $p$ and $q$ are large prime numbers.

 7. **Use of Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT)**:
   - Mention of alternative decoding methodologies using the CRT for systems where $n$ is a product of three or more primes.

 8. **Signature and Verification**:
   - A process for signing and verifying messages using the cryptographic system is described, ensuring message authenticity and integrity.

 9. **Practical Considerations**:
   - Discussion on practical implementation aspects of the cryptographic system, including handling of messages larger than the modulus $n$ and the public availability of encryption keys versus the secrecy of decryption keys.

These equations and concepts form the backbone of the cryptographic methods outlined in the patent, emphasizing secure message transmission, the generation and use of cryptographic keys, and the mathematical underpinnings of encryption and decryption processes.

| 5 | States that the pseudo-random generator and XOR array in the dummy circuit have the same word width as the pre-mix subcircuit, ensuring that the dummy operation mimics the actual encryption process in terms of data handling and timing. |
| 6 | Proposes a method that combines the initial pre-mix XOR operation with the first cipher encryption round for efficiency. This involves pre-processing the cipher key to generate the first round-key words while loading the plaintext, thereby executing the first encryption round immediately after the pre-mix operation. |
